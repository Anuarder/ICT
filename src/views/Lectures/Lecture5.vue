        <h3><a id="Section_1_Data_Storage_and_Backing_Up_Data_1"></a>Section 1. Data Storage and Backing Up Data</h3>
        <p>In this section you will see what is meant by terms ‘data storage’ and ‘backing up data’.</p>
        <h3><a id="Data_Storage_4"></a>Data Storage</h3>
        <p>Data storage is where we put data in a ‘known’ place (Save) which we can come back to later and get the data back again (Read).<br>
        There are some terms that you need to be aware of when we talk about data storage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing of data – Storing data;</li>
            <li>Reading data – Getting our data back.<br>
        Data can either be stored temporary or permanent. Ram is used to store data temporarily. Backing Storage Devices are used to store data permanently.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5><a id="Difference_between_RAM_and_Backing_Storage_Device_11"></a>Difference between RAM and Backing Storage Device</h5>
        <p><em>RAM (computer memory)</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is temporarily stored.</li>
            <li>Volatile – data is erased when computer is switch of.</li>
            <li>Used to only store data that is currently in use.</li>
            <li>Very fast reading/writing of data</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Backing Storage Device</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is permanently stored.</li>
            <li>Non-volatile – data is not erased when computer loses power.</li>
            <li>Used to store data long term.</li>
            <li>Slower reading/writing of data</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Backing_up_Data_24"></a>Backing up Data</h3>
        <p>Backing up is the process of using storage device to copy files and data a different storage medium in case of a problem with the original copy.<br>
        <em>To back up you need 2 pieces of equipment:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Storage device – the hardware that saves or reads the data from the storage medium;</li>
            <li>Storage Medium – The hardware that actually holds the data.<br>
            Backing up is considered ‘good practice’ and helps prevent us from losing our work and files.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Why_Backup_Data_31"></a>Why Backup Data?</h3>
        <p>There are many reasons why backups are made. Some of the common reasons are summarized below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Original data could be accidentally copied over or deleted.</li>
            <li>Data could be lost due to damage to the original storage device.</li>
            <li>You could lose your original storage device.</li>
            <li>Hackers could access our data and delete it.</li>
            <li>Original storage device could be destroyed in a fire.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Section_2_Ways_in_which_Data_Stored_and_Read_39"></a>Section 2. Ways in which Data Stored and Read</h3>
        <p>In this section we will look at the 2 main ways in which data is accessed stored and read:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Serial access;</li>
            <li>Direct access.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a id="Serial_Access_44"></a>Serial Access</h4>
        <p>This method is also sometimes called ‘Sequential Access’.<br>
        Data is accessed by starting at the beginning and then searched through, in order or sequence, until the required information is found.<br>
        The need to search from the beginning of the storage medium makes this type of data access very slow.<br>
        Serial access is used on old magnetic tapes.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/magnetic.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p>There are used where it is necessary to store a lot of data but where speed of access in unimportant.<br>
        Serial access medium are also used in batch processing systems like payroll and in the preparation of utility bills. The way that serial access works means that all of the data has to be read and there is no danger of missing out someone’s wege payment or bill invoice.<br>
        <em>Examples of storage medium that use serial access are:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Videocassettes;</li>
            <li>Music cassettes;</li>
            <li>Backup tape cartridges.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a id="Direct_Access_59"></a>Direct Access</h4>
        <p>This method is also sometimes called ‘Random Access’.<br>
        The computer can calculate exactly where the data has been stored and can go straight to it directly. The computer know where all of the data on the storage medium is and so it can access it very quickly.<br>
        It is not forced to start accessing the data at the beginning and the working through bit-by-bit like with serial access.<br>
        This ‘direct’ method of accessing data is much faster than serial access.</p>
        <h4><a id="Where_direct_Access_is_used_65"></a>Where direct Access is used?</h4>
        <p>This method is used with storage medium such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hard Disk Drives;</li>
            <li>CD’s and DVD’s.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/memory.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p>Direct access is used on most modern storage devices where speed of access is important.<br>
        Direct access medium are used in situations where fast access to data is important like in online booking systems and point-of sale (POS) terminals in shops.<br>
        Other example of storage medium that use direct access are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>USB memory sticks;</li>
            <li>Flash memory;</li>
            <li>Blu-ray discs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Section_3_Storage_Media_Introduction_79"></a>Section 3. Storage Media Introduction</h3>
        <p>In this section you will be introduced to the 3 main types of storage media:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Magnetic storage media;</li>
            <li>Optical storage media;</li>
            <li>Solid state storage media.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a id="Storage_Media_85"></a>Storage Media</h4>
        <p>Storage media is the term given to the devices that are used to hold data. Storage media is ‘permanent storage’ and will hold data even when the computer is powered off. Storage media can either be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Internal – inside the computer;</li>
            <li>External – plugged into the computer from outside.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a id="Types_of_Storage_Media_90"></a>Types of Storage Media</h4>
        <p><em>Magnetic media:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Holds data magnetically;</li>
            <li>Surface area of the media are magnetized so that they can hold ‘bits’ of data;</li>
            <li>The device that reads the media can also read the bits held on the surface area.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Optical media:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Holds data by burning ‘dots’ onto the surface with a high powered laser;</li>
            <li>The device that reads the media can read the data by shining a lower powered laser over the dots.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Solid-state media:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Holds data on devices that have no moving parts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/storage.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="Storage_Capacity_106"></a>Storage Capacity</h3>
        <p>Storage capacity is the term given to the maximum amount of data that can be stored on the media.<br>
        Storage amounts are measured in ‘bytes’ and there are 8 bits in 1 byte.<br>
        Bits are short for ‘binary digits’. This is the smallest unit of data that can be stored. Each ‘bit’ is represented as a binary number, either 1 or 0.<br>
        A single letter on keyboard takes up 1 byte of storage (8 bits).</p>
        <p><em>Storage Capacity Units</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bit -Smallest unit of data (either 1 or 0)</li>
            <li>Byte - 1 byte = 8 bits</li>
            <li>Kilobyte - 1 KB = 1024 bytes</li>
            <li>Megabyte - 1 MB = 1024 Kilobytes</li>
            <li>Gigabyte - 1 GB = 1024 Megabytes</li>
            <li>Terabyte - 1 TB = 1024  Gigabytes</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Storage media all have different storage capacities. For example:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hard disk drives have capacities in the terabytes;</li>
            <li>Floppy disk drives can only hold 1.44 MB of data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Section_4_Magnetic_Storage_Media_126"></a>Section 4. Magnetic Storage Media</h3>
        <p>In this section you will see the 4 different types of magnetic storage media.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed hard disk drive;</li>
            <li>Portable hard disk drive;</li>
            <li>Floppy disk;</li>
            <li>Magnetic tape.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a id="Fixed_Hard_Disk_Drive_135"></a>Fixed Hard Disk Drive</h4>
        <p>Used on all computers and are the main method of storing data, this is because they are capable of very fast direct access of files and have very large storage capacities. The dis surface (Platter) is coated in a magnetic film which is where the data is stored.<br>
        These have read/write heads which allow data to be written to (saved) or read (used) from the disc.<br>
        Hard Discs are used to store operating systems, software application and all other files. Typical storage spaces are 250 gigabytes up to 4 terabytes (4,096 gigabytes).<br>
        Uses of Fixed Hard Disk Drives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used to store the operating system and applications software (Windows, Word, Excel etc.).</li>
            <li>Used for storing files and documents.</li>
            <li>Real-Time systems and online systems use hard disc drives to store data.</li>
        <li>Used in file-servers on computer networks to store files.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Portable_Hard_Disk_Drive_145"></a>Portable Hard Disk Drive</h3>
        <p>Works in a similar way to fixed hard discs but are connected to the computer externally via a Universal Serial Bus (BUS) port. They use direct data access ,methods which makes reading/writing of data very fast. Portable disc Drives are designed to be transportable.<br>
        They come with a USB Cable to allow for easy attachment to other computers which allows for easy backing up/sharing if files. Because they are used outside of the computer they come with protective casing to avoid physical damage to the disc drive. Typical storage spaces are 250 gigabytes up to 3 terabytes (3,072 gigabytes).<br>
        Uses of Portable Hard Disk Drives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Like fixed hard drives, they are used to store large files.</li>
            <li>Can be used as portable back-up systems to avoid loss of data.</li>
            <li>Used to transfer data, files and software between computers via USB connectivity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Floppy_Disk_153"></a>Floppy Disk</h3>
        <p>Old method of portable data storage where information is held om a thin plastic disc. Data on a floppy disk read read/written by a floppy disk drive which rotates the disk. As the disc rotates, a read/write is used to add or read data.<br>
        The data is read/written using direct data access methods.<br>
        The disc of plastic is protected by a retractable metal sleeve and hard plastic casing. A small notch provides write protection.<br>
        Maximum storage on a floppy disc in only about 1.44 MB (00 pages of text).<br>
        Floppy disks do not have high enough capacities to store large modern files. This has made them obsolete and computers no longer have floppy disk drives installed.<br>
        Uses of Floppy Disks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can still be used where very small files need to be transferred/stored.</li>
            <li>Write protect facility is useful to prevent accidental overwriting of data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Magnetic_Tape_163"></a>Magnetic Tape</h3>
        <p>This is one of the oldest forms of computer data storage. Magnetic tape is a thin strip of magnetic coated plastic which is wrapped onto a reel. Data is stored on the magnetic plastic in the form of 1’s and 0’s.<br>
        Data is written to and read from in sequence which is also known as ‘serial access’.<br>
        This is type of storage ,media has a very slow data access rate. Because it is so slowm It is useless for real-time applications.<br>
        Sony have developed magnetic tape capable of storing a huge 185 TB of data.<br>
        Uses of Magnetic Tape:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used where extremely large amounts of data need to be backed up.</li>
            <li>Used where speed of reading/writing of data is NOT a priority.</li>
            <li>Used for backups of computer networks in schools and business.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Section_5_Optical_Storage_Media_173"></a>Section 5. Optical Storage Media</h3>
        <p>In this section you will see the 8 different types of optical storage media.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cd-ROOM</li>
            <li>DVD-ROOM</li>
            <li>CD-R</li>
            <li>DVD-R</li>
            <li>CD-RW</li>
            <li>DVD-RW</li>
            <li>BLU-RAY DISC</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="CDROM_and_DVD_ROM_183"></a>CD-ROM and DVD ROM</h3>
        <p>ROM stands for ‘read only memory’. This means that the data cannot be written over and can only be read. CD-ROM’s and DVD-ROM’s are bought with pre-loaded data already on them. Whatever is already loaded onto the ROM cannot be remover or changed.<br>
        CD-ROMs have a maximum capacity of about 800 MB (about 400, 000 pages of text).<br>
        DVD-ROM’S have a maximum capacity of about 4.7GB (about 2.4 million pages of text).</p>
        <p><em>CD-ROMS are used by manufactures to store smaller files (up to 800 MB) such as:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Music tracks;</li>
            <li>Software;</li>
            <li>Audiobooks;</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>DVD-ROMS have much larger storage capacities (up to 4.7 GB) than CD-ROMS and are used to store bigger files such as:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Movies</li>
            <li>Modern games</li>
            <li>Multimedia encyclopedias</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="CDR_and_DVDR_200"></a>CD-R and DVD-R</h3>
        <p>The letter ‘R’ means that the disc is recordable once only. Once the disc has data recorded in it becomes a CD/DVD ROM. Data can be added to the disc but NOT erased when it is on there. Data is ‘burnt’ onto the discs using a disc burner.<br>
        Thin layer of metallic dye is used to record the data onto.<br>
        When CD-R’s and DVD-R’s are burnt, the laser makes permanent marks on to the metallic dye.<br>
        These marks cannot be erased.</p>
        <p>CD-R have a maximum capacity of about 700 MB (about 80 minutes of audio). DVD-R have a maximum capacity of about 4.7 GB (over 2 hours of video).<br>
        Uses of CD-R and DVD-R:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CD-R’s used to create personalized playlists of music.</li>
            <li>DVD-R;s used to store home recordings of video shot on digital cameras.</li>
            <li>They can be used to backup important data so that there are copies in case the originals get erase or deleted.</li>
            <li>They can be used to transfer data from one computer to another.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="DVDRAM_213"></a>DVD-RAM</h3>
        <p>With DVD-RAM writing and reading data can happen at the same time. They use a similar Phase Changing Recording Dye to CD/DVD-RW’s which allows DVD-RAM discs to be recorded over many times.<br>
        Data can be reliable stored on DVD-RAM for many years die to their high quality.<br>
        DVD-RAM has a capacity of 4.7 GB (or 9.4 GB with double sides discs).</p>
        <h3><a id="Uses_of_DVDRAM_218"></a>Uses of DVD-RAM:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Because DVD-RAM discs last so long they are used in video and data archiving.</li>
            <li>Used in DVD recorders to record TV programmers to allow simultaneous recording and playback.</li>
            <li>Used in camcorders to store video.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Blueray_Disc_223"></a>Blue-ray Disc</h3>
        <p>Work in a similar way to DVD ROMS but the laser used to read the data is blue rather than red.<br>
        Blue lasers are capable of reading data dots that are positioned closer together on the disc surface.<br>
        As result, more data dots (1’s and 0’s) can be stored and read.<br>
        Blu-ray-RW discs can be rewritten to in much the same way as RW discs. Blue-ray’s have capacities of 25 GB, 50 GB and 100GB.<br>
        <em>Uses of Blu-ray Discs:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used to store high definition video.</li>
            <li>Used in some home video consoles.</li>
            <li>Used to bak up hard disk drives in PC’s.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Section_6_State_Storage_Media_233"></a>Section 6. State Storage Media</h3>
        <p>In this section you will see the 4 different types of solid state storage media.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Solid State Hard Drive;</li>
            <li>Memory Stick;</li>
            <li>Flash memory;</li>
            <li>Micro flash memory.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Solid_State_Media_240"></a>Solid State Media</h3>
        <p>Solid State Drives have no moving parts. SSD technology is known as ‘flash memory’ and this is the smallest form of data storage.<br>
        They store data as 1’s and 0’s of on films of magnetic substance or as dots on discs.<br>
        SSD used in desktop PC’s and laptops in place of magnetic hard disk drives.<br>
        <em>They offer advantages magnetic hard drives such as:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Run silently;</li>
            <li>Longer life span;</li>
            <li>Faster data access and transfer times;</li>
            <li>Use less power;</li>
            <li>Produce less heat.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They have a current capacity of about 1TB (approx. 1 million thick books worth of text).<br>
        Uses of Solid State Hard Drives:<br>
        Used in desktop PC’s and laptops to permanently store data such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operating systems;</li>
            <li>Software applications;</li>
            <li>Music/Video files;</li>
