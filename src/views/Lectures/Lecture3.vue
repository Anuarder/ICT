        <h3><a id="Section_1_Operating_Systems_1"></a>Section 1: Operating Systems</h3>
        <p>Operating systems are pieces of software that manage everything that happens in your computer and they instruct the hardware on what to do. The operating system makes your system useful. Without it your computer would sit there and do nothing.</p>
        <p>An operating system is a software program that manages computer resources. Operating systems allow components to communicate with each other and enables<br>
        the computer to run software applications.</p>
        <h3><a id="Types_of_Operation_System_Interfaces_7"></a>Types of Operation System Interfaces</h3>
        <p>The way in which users communicate with computer is called an ‘interface’. The are three types of operating system interfaces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Command Line Interface;</li>
            <li>Graphical User Interface;</li>
            <li>Touchscreen Interface.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Command_Line_Interface_CLI_13"></a>Command Line Interface (CLI)</h3>
        <p>A command line interface is an older style operating system where users type in commands using keyboard.<br>
        Command Line Interface’s do not make use of images, icons or graphics. All the user is sees is a plain black screen like the one to the right.<br>
        There are over 270 different commands that can be entered at the command prompt. Commands have to be entered precisely without spelling mistakes or else the operating system will return an error.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/cli.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p>There are many commands that you can enter into a command line interface.</p>
        <p><em>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</em><br>
        GUI’s are visual interfaces and they are more popular than CLI’s because are very easy to use. The graphics do need more computer power however.<br>
        Instead of typing in commands, the user can use a mouse to point and click objects on the screen.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/gui.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p><em>Touchscreen Interfaces (Post-WIMP Interface)</em><br>
        Portable devices such as mobile phones, PDA’s and tablets use interfaces similar to a GUI (WIMP) where icons and menus are used to input commands.<br>
        Touchscreen technology allows people to use their fingers to select icons and options straight from the device’s screen.</p>

        <h3><a id="Section_2_Recent_Developments_in_ICT_35"></a>Section 2: Recent Developments in ICT</h3>
        <p>ICT is constantly developing and expanding as new technologies become available. In this section, we will look at some of the more recent developments in ICT.</p>
        <h3><a id="Cloud_computing_38"></a>Cloud computing</h3>
        <p>Cloud computing is where users store their documents, programs and data on the Internet rather than on their own computers.<br>
        As long as the user has access to an Internet connection, they can create, edit, and share ICT files from almost any location.<br>
        Because the data and programs are stored remotely, on the Internet, the user will save space on their computer’s storage drives.</p>

        <h3><a id="Advantages_and_Disadvantages_of_Cloud_Computing_45"></a>Advantages and Disadvantages of Cloud Computing</h3>
        <h4><a id="Advantages_46"></a>Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Lower costs: Many programs in the cloud are free to use.</li>
            <li>Increaser accessibility: Programs and documents are accessible no matter where you are as long as you have an Internet connection.</li>
            <li>Time saving: No need to spend time installing software onto your computer as you access it directly from the cloud.</li>
            <li>Increased storage space: Programs and documents are stored in the cloud so this frees up storage space on your computer.</li>
            <li>Backups: Documents in the cloud are automatically backed up for you so you don’t have to remember to do it yourself.</li>
            <li>Sharing of data: Documents can be shared very easily, which is useful for group work.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a id="Disadvantages_54"></a>Disadvantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Security risks: Data stored online is always vunerable to hackers and viruses.</li>
            <li>Decreased accessibility: If you do not have access to the Internet then you cannot access your documents and programs.</li>
            <li>Quality of software: Cloud programs don’t usually have all of the feature of a full version if the software.</li>
            <li>Potential increased costs: Some cloud providers only allow you to use their programs after you have paid a subscription.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>E-books and Online-newspapers (electronic books and newspapers)<br>
        E-books and online newspapers are digital versions of traditional printed publications. E-books and newspapers are readable on a variety of electronic devices such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Desktop PC’s;</li>
            <li>Laptops;</li>
            <li>I-Pads;</li>
            <li>Mobile Phones;</li>
            <li>Amazon Kindles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>E-books have already been created to replace many of old printed books. E-books and newspapers are usually downloaded from the Internet onto the computer or e-reader. Electronic books and newspapers tend to be cheaper to buy than their printed counterparts.</p>

        <h3><a id="Advantages_and_Disadvantages_of_Ebooks_and_Onlinenewspapers_72"></a>Advantages and Disadvantages of E-books and Online-newspapers</h3>
        <h4><a id="Advantages_73"></a>Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Storage benefits: Thousands of digital books can be stored on one computing device or e-book reader.<br>
            The same number of printed paper books would require a very large room in which to store them</li>
            <li>Paperless: Digital books do not need to be printed onto paper. This is much more environmentally friendly.<br>
            Instant access to your book or newspaper: E-books/newspapers can be downloaded from the Internet almost instantly.</li>
            <li>Cheaper to buy: E-books/newspapers generally cost less than printed publications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a id="Disadvantages_80"></a>Disadvantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Health and Safety: Computer screens can reflect light which causes glare. This is can cause headaches and eye strain.</li>
            <li>Piracy: E-books are digital and so are very easy to copy and share.</li>
            <li>Usability: E-books are hard to search through to find specific pages. The pages of printed books can be flipped through quickly to find the page you want.</li>
            <li>High initial costs: Before you can read a digital e-book or newspaper you need either a computer or an e-book reader. These are not cheap.</li>
        </ul>
