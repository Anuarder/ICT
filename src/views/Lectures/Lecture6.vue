        <h3><a id="Section_1_Computer_Networks_Introduction_1"></a>Section 1. Computer Networks Introduction</h3>
        <p>A computer network consists of two or more computers or electronic devices such as printers that have been linked together in order to share data. Networks can vary in size, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Home/school networks can consist of only a few linked computers;</li>
            <li>Huge networks can consist of billions of computers.<br>
            Networks allow users to:</li>
            <li>Share files;</li>
            <li>Send emails to each other;</li>
            <li>Share resources.<br>
            Computer on networks are usually connect using:</li>
            <li>Cables;</li>
            <li>Radio signals;</li>
            <li>Telephone lines and satellites.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Advantages_and_Disadvantages_of_computer_networks_14"></a>Advantages and Disadvantages of computer networks</h3>
        <h4><a id="Advantages_of_computer_networks_15"></a>Advantages of computer networks</h4>
        <p>Connecting computers together on a network offers some advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Resources such as printers, scanners and internet can be shared;</li>
            <li>Files and data can be shared;</li>
            <li>Easy to communicate with people on the network;</li>
            <li>We can access our data from any computer;</li>
            <li>Data can be backed up to a separate computer for security;</li>
            <li>Network administrator can control the network.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Connecting computers together on the internet offers the following advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access huge amount of information and files;</li>
            <li>Communicate with people around the world;</li>
            <li>Access large amounts of media and entertainment;</li>
            <li>Use on-line services like online bankingetc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages of computer networks<br>
        Computers connected to a network can run into problems such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If part, of the network fails – this can cause the whole network to break down;</li>
            <li>Viruses can spread across the network very easily and quickly;</li>
            <li>If a computer on the network is hacked into then all other computers are prone to attack;</li>
            <li>Networks that use too few printers can see printing queues develop.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Computers connected over the internet have a different set of disadvantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We are very prone to virus and spyware infection from other internet users;</li>
            <li>We are open to ‘phishing’ and other scams which target internet users for personal details such as bank numbers etc.</li>
        <li>We can leave ourselves and our children exposed to undesirable material.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Section_2_Types_of_network_computers_42"></a>Section 2. Types of network computers</h3>
        <p>There are two types of computers that make up a network:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Servers;</li>
            <li>Clients.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Servers_48"></a>Servers</h3>
        <p>Servers are powerful computers that provide ‘services’ to the client computers on the network. Servers control the network and tell the client computers what to do.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/server.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h4><a id="Servers_provide_the_following_services_54"></a>Servers provide the following services:</h4>
        <p><em>Providing central storage</em> – Where all users of the network can access the same data.<br>
        <em>Sharing devices</em> – Printers and scanners can be shared among client computers.<br>
        <em>Providing network security</em> – The server makes sure that only people with valid usernames and passwords can log onto client computers on the network.<br>
        <em>Sharing internet connections</em> – The same internet connection can be shared amongst client computers using a router.</p>
        <p>The different types of servers<br>
        <em>File servers</em> – Gives network users a place to save and load their data and files.<br>
        <em>Application servers</em> – Allow computers on the network to run and use applications software that are stored within the server.<br>
        <em>Printer servers</em> – Controls how printing on the network takes place.<br>
        <em>Proxy servers</em> – Used as a kind of security device between client computers and the internet.</p>
        <h3><a id="Client_66"></a>Client</h3>
        <p>A client computer is an individual computer that is used perform everyday tasks and to access information and programs from the server.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/client.png" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="Section_3_Types_of_computer_networks_71"></a>Section 3. Types of computer networks</h3>
        <p>There are four main types of computer networks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>LAN (local area networks);</li>
            <li>WLAN (wireless local area networks);</li>
            <li>WAN (wide area networks);</li>
            <li>Bluetooth.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a id="Local_Area_Networks_LAN_78"></a>Local Area Networks (LAN)</h4>
        <p>Local area networks are usually located in a single room or small building. LAN’s are private and can only be accessed by people in the room or the building. A typical LAN would consist of several computers that are connected to each other and can share resources such as printers and scanners. Computers and devices on a LAN are connected using cables.</p>
        <h4><a id="Wireless_Local_Area_Networks_WLAN_81"></a>Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN)</h4>
        <p>WLAN’s are similar to LAN’s but they connect computers together wirelessly instead of using cables, This is achieved using Wi-Fi technology.<br>
        Routers or wireless switches are used to send and receive data around the network. Client computers or devices send and receive data using wireless adaptors. Most modern laptops, tablets and mobile phones come with built-in Wi-Fi adaptors.<br>
        A typical router can send/receive data to/from computers up to 50 meters away.</p>
        <p>Advantages of WLAN’s:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Physically safer than a LAN because there are no cables to trip over;</li>
            <li>Cheater to set up than a WLAN because you don’t have to buy lots of expensive able;</li>
            <li>Easier toad more computers to the network;</li>
            <li>Devices such as printers and scanners can be connected to the network easily;</li>
            <li>Computers and devices can be used anywhere in the building.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages of WLA’s:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some areas in the building may not pick up the wireless signal;</li>
            <li>Security can be an issue as anyone with a wireless enabled device can try to access the network;</li>
            <li>Wireless signals can be unreliable as they sometimes suffer from interference from other electronic equipment;</li>
            <li>Data transfer around a wireless network is much slower compared to a LAN;</li>
            <li>WLAN’s can be useless for use in a large builing as the signal range is limited.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Wide_Area_Networks_WAN_100"></a>Wide Area Networks (WAN)</h3>
        <p>The internet is the world’s largest WAN. The internet is just millions of computers all over the world that have been connected together so they can share data.<br>
        Wide area networks are made up of computers and devices that are connected over a large geographical area. WAN’s created by connecting lots of LAN’s and individual computers together.<br>
        Computers and devices can connect to a WAN using telephone lines, fibre-optic cables and satellite signals.</p>
        <p>Advantages of WAN’s:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Computers can be connected over wide areas;</li>
            <li>Files and data can be shared over a large area;</li>
            <li>People can use their computers/devices to communicate very quicklym over large areas;</li>
            <li>E-Commerce websites can be set up and accessed by people from all over the world;</li>
            <li>Computers and devices can be used anywhere in the building.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages of WAN’s:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Security can be an issue as anyone with access to the internet can potentially access any of the computers on the network;</li>
            <li>It’s very easy to accidentally download viruses from a WAN onto your computer;</li>
            <li>Data is transferred across a WAN a much slower rate than it is across a LAN</li>
            <li>Monitoring a WAN can be difficult because they have so many computers connected to them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Bluetooth_118"></a>Bluetooth</h3>
        <p>Bluetooth is also known as a Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN). Bluetooth devices can connect to each other from between 1 and 100 meters away. The connection is made without using wires or cables.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/bluetooth.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Advantages of Bluetooth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Very easy to connect Bluetooth devices together;</li>
            <li>Bluetooth signals are not easily to disrupt;</li>
            <li>Works wirelessly so there are no messy cables needed to connect devices;</li>
            <li>Bluetooth uses very little power.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages of Bluetooth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited signal range;</li>
            <li>Slow data transfer. Bluetooth is not suitable for transferring large files;</li>
            <li>Very unsecure connections and easy for hackers to break into.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Section_4_Network_Devices_135"></a>Section 4. Network Devices</h3>
        <p>There are seven main device that are used to build a network. These are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Router;</li>
            <li>Network Interface Cards (NIC);</li>
            <li>Network Cable;</li>
            <li>Hubs;</li>
            <li>Switches;</li>
            <li>Bridges;</li>
            <li>Modems.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Router_145"></a>Router</h3>
        <p>Routers enable data to be sent between different types of networks. Routers are most commonly used to connect computers and devices to the internet. Computers can connect to a router either through cable or wirelessly.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/router.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p>All computers and devices connected to the internet are assigned a unique number called at Internet Protocol Address (IP Address). The IP address of the device would depend on where in the world it connected to the internet from. Computers on the same network would share the same first few numbers of the IP address. This is used to locate the network.</p>
        <p>Routers store IP addresses in something called a routing table. The routing table lists all of the different routes to other networks. The router will use the routing table to determine the best route to use when sending data to another network.</p>
        <p>Routers send ‘packets’ of data between computers on different networks. Each data packet contains the IP address of the computer / network that the data is being sent to. The router will use the IP address to work out the best route in which to send the data to it’s destination.</p>
        <h4><a id="Network_Interface_Card_NIC_156"></a>Network Interface Card (NIC)</h4>
        <p>Network Interface Cards are used to connect individual computer/devices to a network. Network interface cards have ports which allow network cables to be plugged in and connect the computer to the network. There are two types of network interface card:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wired network interface card (Where cables are used to connect computers);</li>
            <li>Wireless network interface card (Where computers are connected using Wi-Fi)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a id="Network_cable_161"></a>Network cable</h4>
        <p>Network cables are plugged into a computers wired network interface card and connects it to the network. Data is sent around the network via the network cable.<br>
        Cable holds advantages over wireless connections for two reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cables can transfer data faster than wireless;</li>
            <li>Data transferred over cables is more secure than over wireless.</li>
            <li>Network cables are made up of different wires:</li>
            <li>Some wires are used to send data to the computer;</li>
            <li>Some wires are used to receive data from the computer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/network.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h4><a id="Hubs_172"></a>Hubs</h4>
        <p>Hubs allow computers and devices to plug into their ports in order to connect to each other and share files, data and resources. Hubs are ‘non-intelligent’ devices and they don’t manage any of the data that flows through them. When data gets sent to the hub there is no is o attempt to locate the computer/device that the data is meant for.<br>
        The hub simply sends the data onto every computer/device network. This means that every device on the network will receive the same data whether they requested it or not.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/hubs.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p>This lack of data management makes networks that are connected by hubs very slow because there is a lot of unnecessary data flowing around.<br>
        Hubs are old technology and have been replaced by switches which manage data more effectively and operate much faster.</p>
        <h3><a id="Switch_181"></a>Switch</h3>
        <p>Switches are similar to hubs in that they connect computers/devices to form a LAN. Switchers are ‘intelligent’ devices and transmit data around the network more efficiently.</p>
        <h3><a id="Switches_manage_data_is_summarized_below_185"></a>Switches manage data is summarized below:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Each network device has a Media Access Control address which uniquely identifies it.</li>
            <li>Data sent to the switch contains the MAC address of the sending devices and the MAC address of the receiving device.</li>
            <li>The switch will check these addresses and only send the data to the relevant device rather than to all  devices.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Bridge_190"></a>Bridge</h3>
        <p>Bridges are used to connect LAN’s together. Bridges can connect different types of networks so that they act as one single LAN and thus can communicate with each other.</p>
        <h3><a id="Modems_193"></a>Modems</h3>
        <p>Modems stands for ‘Modulator Demodulator’. Modems used to connect computers to the internet before we had the use of broadband connections.</p>
        <p>Most internet connections are made over telephone lines. Telephone lines are designed to carry sound and voices, which are analogue signals.</p>
        <p>The problem is that computer data is digital and it is not possible to send digital data over an analogue telephone line.</p>
        <p>This is where the modem comes in.<br>
        The modern convert can convert the digital computer data into an analogue signal/noise (modulate) so it can be sent over the analogue telephone line.<br>
        Modems can also reverse this process and convert the analogue signal from the telephone line unto digital data (demodulate) so the computer ca use it.</p>
        <p>Modems contain both a Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC) and a Analogue to Digital converter (ADC). DAC converts the digital data from the computer into an analogue signal which can then be sent down the telephone line. ADC converts the analogue signal in the telephone line into digital data so that the computer can process and use the data.</p>
        <h3><a id="Section_5_Internet_and_intranet_206"></a>Section 5. Internet and intranet</h3>
        <p>There are two main types of network environments. These are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Internet;</li>
            <li>Intranet.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Internet_211"></a>Internet</h3>
        <p>The internet is a huge collection of computers and networks that have been joined together. When you connect your device/computer to the internet, you can potentially access and share data from other computers that are connected.<br>
        The internet started off as a military project in the 1960’s called ‘ARPANet’. ARPANet was initially designed to connect 4 powerful computers so that researches had access to them all. Over the years more and more computers connected to ARPANet until it eventually became the internet that we know today.<br>
        The list below highlights this and some other uses of the internet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browsing web pages using the World Wide Web;</li>
            <li>Sending and receiving emails;</li>
            <li>Sharing files and information;</li>
            <li>Video Conferencing;</li>
            <li>Voice call;</li>
            <li>Streaming music and video;</li>
            <li>Online banking;</li>
            <li>E-Commerce;</li>
            <li>Advertising;</li>
            <li>Blogging;</li>
            <li>Social media;</li>
            <li>Playing multi-player online games.<br>
            To access the internet you need several things:</li>
            <li>A computer or device;</li>
            <li>A router or a modem;</li>
            <li>An ISP (internet service provider).<br>
            Internet Service Providers are companies that provide users with access to the internet, usually for a monthly or annual fee. Once you have paid your fee to the ISP, you would be given a username and password which you can use to connect to the internet.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a id="Intranets_233"></a>Intranets</h4>
        <p>Intranets are like a private internet. They are only accessible by users of the intranet. Intranets offer similar features to the internet such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Viewing web pages;</li>
            <li>Sending emails;</li>
            <li>Sharing files and information;</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Schools often make use of intranets to provide information to students. This information could include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning resources;</li>
            <li>Course information;</li>
            <li>Homework schedules;</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anyone with the right to use an intranet would be given a login id and password. Anyone without the correct login details would be unable to connect.<br>
        Login id’s can also be used to restrict users from accessing certain parts of the intranet.</p>
        <h4><a id="Comparing_the_internet_and_intranet_249"></a>Comparing the internet and intranet</h4>
        <p><em>Internet:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The term ‘Internet’ comes from the phrase International Network.</li>
            <li>The internet is used to share data globally.</li>
            <li>The internet is used to provide information that is relevant to a wide range of people.</li>
            <li>The internet can be accessed from anywhere as long as you have an internet collection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Intranet:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The term ‘intranet’ comes from the phrase Internal Restricted Access Network.</li>
            <li>Intranets are used to share data locally and privately.</li>
            <li>Intranets are used to provide information which is relevant to a single company or organization.</li>
            <li>Intranets can only be accessed from within the company or organization that owns it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="Section_6_Bluetooth_and_WiFi_262"></a>Section 6. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi</h3>
        <p>The two main technologies that computers can use to communicate wirelessly are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wi-fi;</li>
            <li>Bluetooth.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a id="Wifi_267"></a>Wi-fi</h4>
        <p>Wi-Fi allows computer/devices to connect to each other wirelessly, without using cable or wires. The computers communicate with each other by using signals that are broadcast using radio waves.<br>
        In order to use Wi-Fi, you need to have access to the internet and a router. Areas where computer/devices can access the internet using Wi-Fi are known as hotspots.<br>
        Routers are commonly used to provide a hotspot for other computers to connect to the internet. The router will be connected to the internet through an ISP and will transmit a wireless signal that wireless devices nearby can tap into. This allows multiple devices to share the same internet connection.<br>
        Routers can only broadcast the wireless signal over a limited distance. If a device is out of range, it will not able to tap into the signal. The range limit of a typical route is between 50m and 100m.</p>
        <p>In order to connect to a network using Wi-Fi you would need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A computer or device;</li>
            <li>A wireless network interface card;</li>
            <li>Access to a wireless hotspot.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a id="Bluetooth_279"></a>Bluetooth</h4>
        <p>Bluetooth is also known as a Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN). Bluetooth is a form of wireless technology that uses radio waves to transfer data over distances of between 1 and 100 meters.<br>
        Devices that have this technology contain one of three classes of Bluetooth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Class 1 – Most powerful – can transmit data up to 100m;</li>
            <li>Class 2 – Most common – can transmit data up to 10m;</li>
            <li>Class 3 – Least powerful – can transmit data up to 1m.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bluetooth has a wide-range of uses some of these are summarized in the table below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use input/output devices wirelessly – Devices like keyboards, mouse, printers and speakers can be connected to a computer system without the need for messy wires.</li>
            <li>Sharing mobile phone data between devices – Data like contact numbers can easily be transferred from one phone to another.</li>
            <li>Connecting to hands-free headsets – Wireless headsets allow people to talk into their mobile phones whilst driving.</li>
        </ul>
