        <h3><a id="Hardware_Software_and_Computer_Types_1"></a>Hardware, Software and Computer Types</h3>
        <p>This section will take a look at hardware/software and the different types of computers.</p>
        <h3><a id="Hardware_3"></a>Hardware</h3>
        <p>Hardware is ‘physical’. Physical means it can be touched and picked up. Hardware works with computer code to carry out jobs such as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Producing an image on a computer screen;</li>
        <li>Producing sound;</li>
        <li>Moving cursers / pointers around a screen.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a id="Software_11"></a>Software</h3>
        <p>Software cannot be touched or picked up. This is because software is not physical. It exists as computer code inside the computer.</p>
        <p>There are 2 types of software – System Software and Application Software. It refers to the programs that we run our computer and it tells the hardware how to do something useful. Software is basically a set of instructions (written in computer code) tat tells the hardware what to do.<br>
        Without software, most hardware would be useless.</p>

        <h3><a id="Types_of_Computers_19"></a>Types of Computers</h3>
        <p>Computers allow us to perform many different tasks from gaming to complicated calculations. Computers range from very large to very small and it is estimated that there are over 1 billion of them in use around the world.</p>
        <p><em>Personal Computer (PC)</em><br>
        Personal computer are usually found in the home. They are designed to be used by one person at a time and perform tasks such as school work, gaming, household accounts, internet access and emailing.<br>
        Personal computers are made up of input devices, output devices and storage devices all held together within a base unit which houses all the hardware components that make the PC work.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/desktop.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="Laptop_28"></a>Laptop</h3>
        <p>Laptops are portable computers and are small enough to sit on your lap. They can be used almost anywhere due to their small size and a built-in-battery which powers the laptop when there is no access to a plug socket.</p>
        <p>Modern laptops are generally almost as powerful as a Desktop PC and are used for similar tasks and purposes.</p>
        <p>They have LCD screens (Liquid Crystal Display) which use low-power. This helps increase the run-time a laptop’s battery.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/laptop.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="Mainframes_37"></a>Mainframes</h3>
        <p>Mainframes are very large and expensive and are capable of supporting hundreds, or even thousands, of users at the same time. They are used in large organizations for processing huge amounts of data or to control massive networks of computers.</p>
        <p>Mainframes use more than one processor which means they can process many jobs at the same time. Early mainframes were the size of a room and got their name because they were housed in large metal ‘frames’.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/mainframe.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="Netbook_44"></a>Netbook</h3>
        <p>Netbooks are extremely small and light versions of laptops. Netbooks can be used for similar tasks to a laptop but they are not as powerful and have much smaller screens.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/netbook.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="PDA_personal_digital_assistant_49"></a>PDA (personal digital assistant)</h3>
        <p>PDA’s are handheld computers with facilities including:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Personal organizer;</li>
        <li>Internet browsing;</li>
        <li>Telephone calls;</li>
        <li>Multimedia</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a id="Section_12_Components_of_a_Computer_System_and_Storage_Devices_60"></a>Section 1.2: Components of a Computer System and Storage Devices</h3>
        <p>In this section we will look at the different components (parts) of a computer system.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/components.gif" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="Features_of_Internal_Hardware_Computer_Components_66"></a>Features of Internal Hardware Computer Components</h3>
        <p>Internal computer components are designed to fit inside the computer system and they all carry out important roles. We will discuss the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Motherboard</li>
        <li>Processor</li>
        <li>Internal Memory</li>
        <li>Sound Card</li>
        <li>Internal Hard Disk Drive</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Motherboard</em><br>
        The motherboard is central to any computer system. All components plug into the motherboard either directly or indirectly.<br>
        Once connected to the motherboard, the components ca work together to form the computer system. Components communicate and send signals to each other via the BUS Network.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/mortherboard.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="Processor_CPU__Central_Processing_Unit_80"></a>Processor (CPU / Central Processing Unit)</h3>
        <p>The Central Processing Unit is the brain of the computer.</p>
        <p>The CPU ‘controls’ what the computer does and is responsible for performing calculations and data processing. It also handles the movement of data to and from system memory.</p>
        <p>CPU’s come in a variety of speeds which are known as ‘clock rates’. Clock rates are measured in ‘Hertz’. Generally, the faster the clock rate, the faster the performance of the computer.</p>
        <p>There two main brands of CPU currently on the market: AMD and Intel.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/processor.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="Internal_Memory_92"></a>Internal Memory</h3>
        <p>RAM (Random Access Memory)<br>
        RAM is used to temporarily store information that is currently in use by the computer. This is can include anything from word documents to videos.<br>
        RAM can be read from and written to and so the information stored in RAM can change all the time.<br>
        RAM is a fast memory. Data can be Written to and read from RAM very quickly. RAM is generally measured in GB.<br>
        RAM is Volatile Memory. This means that information stored in RAM is deleted as soon as the computer is turned off.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/ram.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="ROM_Read_Only_Memory_101"></a>ROM (Read Only Memory)</h3>
        <p>ROM is used to permanently store instructions that ell the computer how to boot. It also loads the operating system. These instructions are known as the BIOS or the boot program.<br>
        ROM is Non-Volatile memory. This means that stored information is not lost when the computer loses power.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/rom.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="Video_Card_107"></a>Video Card</h3>
        <p>Graphics cards are hardware devices that plug into the motherboard and enables the computer to display images on the monitor. Graphics cards usually require the installation of software alongside the hardware. The software instructs the computer how to use the graphics card and also allows you to alter settings to change image quality and size.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/videocard.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="Sound_Card_113"></a>Sound Card</h3>
        <p>Sound cards are internal hardware devices that plug into the motherboard. A sound card’s main function is to allow the computer system to produce sound but they also allow users to connect microphones in order to input sounds into the computer.<br>
        Sound cards are also useful in the conversion of analogue data into digital and vice versa.</p>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/soundcard.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <h3><a id="Storage_devices_119"></a>Storage devices</h3>
        <p>Secondary storage devices are used to store data that is not instantly needed by the computer. Secondary storage devices permanently store data and programs for as long as we need. These devices are also used to back-up-data in case original copies are lost or damaged.<br>
        There are two categories of storage devices:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Internal Storage  - Internal hard Disk Drives;</li>
        <li>External Storage – External Hard Disk Drive, Memory Stick etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="img-block"><img src="../../assets/memory.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p>Features of External Hardware Computer Components<br>
        External computer components connect to a computer system form outside. They are not necessary for the system to function but make our experiences easier or better.</p>
        <p><em>Input Devices</em><br>
        Input devices are pieces of hardware that get raw data into the computer ready for processing<br>
        Processing involves taking raw data and turning it into more useful information.<br>
        Input devices fall into two categories:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Manual Input Devices – Need to be operated by a human to input information;</li>
        <li>Automatic Input  Devices – Can input information on their own.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Output Devices</em><br>
        Some output devices send information out temporarily and some send information out permanently:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Temporary Output Devices - E.g. Monitors which constantly refresh the outputted image on the screen;</li>
        <li>Permanent Output Devices – E.g. Printers which output information onto paper as a hard copy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Peripheral Devices</em><br>
        These are ‘non-essential’ hardware components that usually connect ot the system externally. Peripheral are called non-essential because the System can operate without them.</p>
