        <h1>Lecture 1: THE EFFECTS OF USING ICT</h1>
        <h3>Section 1: The Effects of ICT on Society</h3>
        <p>ICT has had many impacts upon our lives both for the better and for the worse.This section looks at some of these impacts that ICT has had upon society and includes impacts on employment, online shopping, how computers are used in household appliances and how computers have given us the ability to never actually leave our houses.</p>
        <h3>Why do businesses use ICT?</h3>
        <p>Computer usage in businesses and companies has increased massively within the last 30 years. The benefits that computers bring to business is just too hard for the owners to ignore. For examples:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Speed – Data can be stored, processed and searched extremely fast;</li>
        <li>Volume – Vast quantities of data can be stored in small amounts of space;</li>
        <li>Less Paper Work - Computers remove the need for huge quantities of paper-work;</li>
        <li>Less Workers – Computers can do the work of many people which saves expenses in wages;</li>
        <li>Connectivity – The Internet means that companies can share data or even hold meetings in different countries without actually leaving the office.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What effects has ICT had upon employment?</h3>
        <p>Effects of ICT on employment patterns include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Fewer workers needed to achieve the same amount of work;</li>
        <li>Automation in factories (robots doing the work of people);</li>
        <li>Increased ‘teleworking’ (working from home);</li>
        <li>Increased need for highly trained ICT specialists;</li>
        <li>Decreased need for ‘labor intensive workers’ (like filing, printers etc);</li>
        <li>Need for workers to be trained more frequently (to keep up with the changes in ICT);</li>
        <li>Fewer ‘face-to-face’ meetings as video conferences can be held over the Internet (reduced travel time and cost);</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Areas where jobs have been created</h3>
        <p>ICT  has brought new jobs to the world These include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Network Managers/Technicians;</li>

            <li>Valves to let water in;</li>
            <li>Pumps to let water out.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="img-block"><img  src="../../assets/washingMachines.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <h3>Effects of microprocessors on leisure time</h3>
        <p>Microprocessor – controlled devices allow us to do our daily tasks quicker. This gives us more time for leisure and other things that we might enjoy.<br>
        Other ways in which microprocessors can affect how we spend our leisure time are listed below:<br>
        <em>Working on the move:</em><br>
        Laptops, PDA’s, Mobile Phones, IPads etc, allow us to work on the move which means we get to enjoy more free time.</p>
        <div class="img-block"><img  src="../../assets/laptop.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p><em>More time spent gaming:</em><br>
        There has been a huge increase in the demand for gaming over the last 20 years. More and more people spend a large amount of free time playing the latest computer games.</p>
        <div class="img-block"><img  src="../../assets/gaming.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p><em>Increased leisure time:</em><br>
        Microprocessors in household appliances can make sure that the task is completed without you actually being there.</p>
        <div class="img-block"><img  src="../../assets/jumping.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Accessing chat rooms and chatting there;</li>
            <li>Instant messaging.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="img-block"><img  src="../../assets/smartphone.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p><em>Social Networking Sites</em><br>
        Social Networking Sites are growing more and more popular as a way to keep in contact with friends. Facebook alone has almost 1 billion active users.<br>
        These sites have many ways in which you can interact including:</p>

            <li>Chat-rooms</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Section 2: The Capabilities and Limitations of ICT</h3>
        <p>ICT devices and systems have many capabilities (thinks they do well) and limitations (things they don’t do so well).<br>
        This section looks at some of these capabilities and limitations.</p>
        <h3>What things do ICT devices do well?</h3>
        <p>ICT devices and systems are capable of performing lots of tasks very well. Some of these are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Speed – Computers performs tasks very fast. Some CPU’s can execute literally ‘billions’ of instructions per second.</li>
            <li>Accuracy – if programmed properly, computers are capable of performing the same tasks 100% accurately every time.</li>
            <li>Multi-Tasking – Computers are able to perform many tasks at the same time.</li>
            <li>Repetitive Tasks – Computers will carry out boring and repetitive tasks accurately. Humans tend to get bored and make mistakes.</li>
            <li>Networking – Computers can be joined together and allows them to easily share resources such as printers and data.<br>
            -.  Huge amounts of Data Storage – Computer databases can store enormous amounts of data.</li>
            <li>Fast Searches – Computers can search for stored data extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Security – Data can be secured with passwords or encryption.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What things do ICT devices not do well?</h3>
        <p>Computers, and other devices, are not without their problems. Limitations of ICT devices are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Battery life – Portable device such at laptops, PDAs and mobile phones are limited by their battery life. These devices only remain charged for so long before they need to be plugged into the mains.</li>
            <li>FAIL Blog;</li>
            <li>Mashable;</li>
            <li>Engadget;</li>
            <li>Hiffington Post;</li>
            <li>TMZ.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Wikis</h3>
        <p>Wikis are interactive web pages that can be viewed and edited by users. Anyone with a web browser can visit a wiki and make changes to the content.</p>
        <p><em>The best known wiki on the web is probably Wikipedia.</em></p>
        <p><em>Digital media sharing websites</em><br>
        These websites allow users to upload video and images which can then be viewed by other people.<br>
        Video sharing websites, in particular, are helping to change the way in which we can learn on the Internet.<br>
        One of the advantages of digital media websites is that the owners of the videos and images do not need to waste their own hard drive space storing them. The files are held ‘remotely’ on the websites servers.<br>
        The best known video sharing website is You Tube and for images Flickr.</p>
        <div class="img-block">
            <img src="../../assets/wiki.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p><em>Undesirable information</em><br>
        Undesirable websites are those that include content that is offensive to individuals or even races. Undesirable content can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pornography;</li>
            <li>Violent videos or images;</li>
            <li>Content promoting hatred;</li>
            <li>Racial content.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Security of information on the Internet</h3>
        <p>We store a lot of information on our computers and mobile devices. Some of this information is sensitive and personal and we would not want if falling into the wrong hands. Sensitive information can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Credit card details;</li>
            <li>Banking information;</li>
            <li>Addresses / Phone numbers of friends and family.<br>
            As soon as we log onto the Internet our sensitive information is at risk of ‘hackers’ and ‘fraudsters’ from trying to steals it. Common methods include:</li>
            <li>Phishing</li>
            <li>Pharming</li>
            <li>Spam</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Phishing</em><br>
        ‘Phishing’ is used to describe methods that thieves use to ‘fish’ for our data. This is where fraudsters try and trick us into giving up our bank details, credit card, details, usernames and passwords.<br>
        Phishing is usually carried out over emails pretending to be from legitimate organizations like banks and building societies.</p>
        <p><em>Pharming</em><br>
        The intention of pharming is the same as phishing to obtain personal information such as usernames, passwords and bank details etc. Pharming usually targets users of online banking or shopping websites.<br>
        The way this is done however is slightly different. ‘Pharmers’ infect legitimate websites with malicious code that will ‘re-direct’ you to their bogus version of the website.<br>
        The bogus website will lock very similar, or even identical, as the legitimate website. This makes pharming very dangerous and difficult to detect.</p>
        <p><em>Spam</em><br>
        Spam is ‘junk email’ that is sent automatically to thousands, or even millions, of email inboxes. Span over-runs your inbox very quickly and it is a pain to have to delete all of these unwanted emails every day.<br>
        ‘Spammers’ send these unwanted emails for a range of different reasons including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising low quality products;</li>
            <li>Spreading viruses;</li>
            <li>Phishing purposes.<br>
            Spammers get your email address from a range of sources. This is called ‘harvesting email addresses’. The sources include:</li>
            <li>Mailing lists;</li>
            <li>Chat rooms;</li>
            <li>Programs that scour websites for email addresses;</li>
            <li>Bought illegally from dishonest employee’s of internet companies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Section 4: Health and Safety</h3>
        <p>There are a number of safety hazards linked with using computers and ICT devices.<br>
        This section looks into some of these potential hazards and what you can do to prevent them.<br>
        We will also look at some of the medical conditions and health problems that prolonged use of ICT devices can cause and what you can do to avoid them.</p>
        <p><em>Health problems</em><br>
        There are a number of health problems that you can suffer if you use ICT devices incorrectly or for too long. The maim ones are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI);</li>
            <li>Back and Neck Strain;</li>
            <li>Eye Strain and Headaches.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)</em><br>
        RSI causes painful swelling of the wrist and fingers. Sufferers with really bad RSI are unable to use their hands at all.<br>
        RSI is caused by doing the same small movements over and over again across a long period of time.</p>
        <h3>Section 5: Negative Aspects of ICT</h3>
        <p>ICT can affect our lives in both positive and negative ways. In this section we take a look at some of the problems that the use of ICT can bring.<br>
        Some of the areas we will cover include copyright problems, viruses and hacking.</p>
        <p><em>Software Copyright Theft</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Overview of software copyright theft:</li>
            <li>Software is often developed at massive costs by companies and individuals.</li>
            <li>Because software is digital, it is very easy to either download illegally from the internet or make copies of it without the permission of the owner. This is often called ‘Software Piracy’.</li>
            <li>Laws exist to help the developers of software from having their work downloaded or copied by others free.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>What do these laws cover?</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Software should not be copied, sold or given away to other people.</li>
            <li>Software should not be used on a network of more users than you have paid for (e.g. 20 users instead of 10)</li>
            <li>Renting out software without permission is illegal</li>
            <li>Stealing code from software and the using it in your own software product is illegal</li>
            <li>Using the name of copyright software on your product is illegal (passing off your product as Microsoft Word for example)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Software Piracy Prevention</em><br>
        Software can be protected against piracy in a number of ways including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Serial Numbers</li>
            <li>Holograms</li>
            <li>License agreements</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Serial Numbers</em><br>
        When software is being installed, users are often asked to enter a unique number which proves the software is original. Serial numbers are supplied with the original copy of the software.</p>
        <p><em>Holograms</em><br>
        Holograms are often used on the packaging of software and they indicate that the copy is genuine. Software without a hologram on the packaging is usually an illegal copy.</p>
        <p><em>Licence Agreements</em><br>
        Licence agreements are part of the software installation process and the inform the user exactly how they are legally allowed to use the product.<br>
        Users are required ‘agree to terms of use’ before they can complete the installation.</p>
        <h3>Computer Viruses</h3>
        <p>Computer viruses can cause huge problems if they are allowed to infect a computer. Viruses are programs that automatically make replicates of themselves and then attach to other tiles within the computer.Any files which have viruses attached to them are said to have been ‘infected’.<br>
        Viruses can be designed to carry out different malicious functions. Some include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Annoying pop-up messages on the screen;</li>
            <li>Causing the computer to slow down or even crash;</li>
            <li>Deleting important files or programs;</li>
            <li>Trying to access your personal files like passwords, bank details or credit card numbers etc.<br>
            There are many ways that viruses can infect a computer. The most common include:</li>
            <li>Downloading infected files from the internet;</li>
            <li>Email attachments that contain infected files;</li>
            <li>Plugging a flash memory stick that containing infected files into your computer.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Preventing Software Virus Infections</h5>
        <p>New computer viruses are being created all the time and this means that you should take steps to reduce the chance that you computer and data become infected. The best methods are outlined in the table below:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>Use up-to-date anti-virus software.</li>
            <li>Use genuine copies of software.</li>
            <li>Only open email attachments from people you trust.</li>
            <li>Scan flash memory with anti-virus software before you attach it to your computer.</li>
            <li>Only download software from legitimate websites.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Hacking</h5>
        <p>Hacking is where people ‘break’ into computer systems without permission. These people are known as ‘hackers’.<br>
        Hackers often use the Internet to break into the system.<br>
        Hackers try to break into computers for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To cause damage to files and data by deleting or changing them;</li>
            <li>To commit fraud by stealing data;</li>
            <li>To access sensitive information;</li>
            <li>Simply to see if they are clever enough to beat the system’s security.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="img-block"><img  src="../../assets/hacking.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <h5>Preventing Hacking and Hackers</h5>
        <p>There are various methods you can use to help stop hackers from accessing your computer files and data.These include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Firewall’s;</li>
        <li>User-ID’s and Robust Passwords;</li>
        <li>Data Encryption.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Firewall’s</h5>
        <p>Firewall’s provide a ‘shield’ between your computer and the Internet. Firewall’s can block unwanted data from reaching your computer. They can also stop your computer from connecting to unwanted websites.</p>
        <h5>User-ID’s and Robust Passwords</h5>
        <p>User UD’s: A user-ID’s usually a word or a number that identifies particular users as they log onto the computer system.<br>
        User ID’s give people access to certain areas or files within the computers.<br>
        Robus passwords (hard to guess):A good password should be to guess. It should be made up of a combination of letter and numbers and changed regularly.</p>
        <div class="img-block"><img  src="../../assets/password.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <h5>Data encryption</h5>
        <p>Encryption makes the files on you system unreadable if the user does not know the password to un-encrypt them.<br>
        Ifs someone try’s to read an encrypted file they will just see random junk instead of the real data.</p>
    </div>
